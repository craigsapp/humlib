The two main member functions for reading and writing Standard MIDI Files
are <span class="function">read</span> and <span class="function">write</span>.
The argument to these functions can be either a filename or an input/output
stream object.  The <span class="function">status</span> function can be
called after reading or writing to determine if the action was successful.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::read"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">read</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Read a Standard MIDI File in binary or ASCII formats.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::write"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">write</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Write a Standard MIDI file from the MidiFile contents.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::status"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">status</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Returns true if last read/write was successful.</span></div>

<br/>
Two additional functions, called
<span class="function">writeHex</span> and
<span class="function">writeBinasc</span>
can be used to print ASCII hex codes that determinstically
represent a binary Standard MIDI File.  The
<span class="function">read</span> function will transparently parse
either binary MIDI files, or their ASCII representations in one of these
two formats.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::writeHex"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">writeHex</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Print MidiFile as a list of ASCII hex bytes.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::writeBinasc"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">writeBinasc</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Print ASCII version of MIDI file in binasc format.</span></div>
