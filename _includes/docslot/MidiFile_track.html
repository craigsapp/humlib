The MidiFile class contains a list tracks, each stored as a
  <span class="class-link">MidiEventList</span>
object.  The [] operator accesses each list, and the
   <span class="function">getTrackCount</span>
function will report the current number of tracks in a MidiFile
object.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::operatorSQUAREBRACKETS"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">operatorSQUAREBRACKETS</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Returns the list of events for a track.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::getTrackCount"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">getTrackCount</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Return the number of tracks in the MidiFile.</span></div>

<br/>
The tracks in a MidiFile can reversibly be merged into a single
event list by calling the
   <span class="function">joinTracks</span>
function.  This will cause the
   <span class="function">getTrackCount</span>
function to report that there is one track in the file, and if the
file is written in this state, it will be saved as a type-0 MIDI
file (from which the multi-track state will not be recoverable).
Before tracks are joined, the events in each track must be in correct
time sequence, so the
   <span class="function">sort</span>
function may need to be called before joining the tracks.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::joinTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">joinTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Merge all tracks into a single stream of events.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::splitTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">splitTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Separate events into their original track configuration.</span></div>

<br/>
The
   <span class="function">hasJoinedTracks</span>
and
   <span class="function">hasSplitTracks</span>
functions can be used to detect the current state of the tracks in
a MidiFile.  By default, a MidiFile will be in the split state.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::hasJoinedTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">hasJoinedTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Return true if MidiFile is in the joined-track state.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::hasSplitTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">hasSplitTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Return true if MidiFile is in the split-track state.</span></div>

<br/>
When a MidiFile is in the joined state, the original track is stored in
the track variable of each 
  <span class="class-link">MidiEvent</span>.
The
   <span class="function">getSplitTrack</span> 
function returns the track index for when a MidiFile is in the
split state.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::getSplitTrack"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">getSplitTrack</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Get the track number of an event when MidiFile is in split state.</span></div>

<br/>
Here are functions which relate to adding, deleting and merging
tracks:

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::addTrack"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">addTrack</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Added one or more empty tracks to the MidiFile.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::deleteTrack"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">deleteTrack</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Remove the specified track from the MidiFile.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::mergeTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">mergeTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Combine two tracks into a single track.</span></div>

<br/>
When a MidiFile is in absolute-tick mode (see further below), the
tick variable of
  <span class="class-link">MidiEvent</span>
objects in the MidiFile are the total number of ticks since the
start time for the file.  In the absolute-tick mode, MidiEvents can
be added to tracks in non-sequential order.  To re-arrange the
events into proper time order (such as before writing the file),
use the
   <span class="function">sortTracks</span> function, which will
   sort all
tracks in the MIDI file, or
   <span class="function">sortTrack</span> function, which will
   sort a
particular track by its index number.

<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::sortTracks"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">sortTracks</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Sort all tracks in the MidiFile by event timestamps.</span></div>
<div class="docslot" id="MidiFile::sortTrack"><span class="docslot-short-title" style="padding-left:19px;">sortTrack</span><span class="short-desc"> &mdash; Sort a track in terms of timestamps of the events.</span></div>
