<span class="snippet-title">Access a particular token.</span>

Access the token in the second field of the fourth line (`12e` in
the above example). This can be done in two ways: either address
the HumdrumLine by the [] operator of HumdrumFile and then the data
files with HumdrumLine::token, or access the HumdrumToken directly
from the HumdrumFile::token function, giving the line and field
index as arguments.

```cpp
infile[3].token(1);    // 12e
infile.token(3, 1);    // 12e
```
