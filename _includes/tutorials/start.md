The example code given in the following tutorials can be compiled
by creating a directory called `myprograms` in the base directory
of the minHumdrum library.  Then if you create a file called
`myprograms/myprog.cpp`, you can type:

```console
make myprog
```

in the base directory to compile the program.  The executable,
`myprog` will be created in the `bin` directory.  Note that you may
need to compile the library first with the command:

```console
make
```
