The \*\*recip data type in the standard Humdrum Toolkit cannot represent
non-integral subdivisions of whole notes, and has difficulty representing
rhythms larger than a whole note.  The humlib library understands 
a rational-number extension to \*\*recip data (i.e., **kern rhythms).

For example, triplet whole notes are equivalent to 2/3rds of a whole note.
This is represented as `3%2` in the extended **recip format, where the
denominator of the whole-note division is given first, followed by a 
percent sign, and then the numerator.  By extension, a quarter note
which is usually represented as `4` can alternately be be represented
as `4%1` in the extended format.
