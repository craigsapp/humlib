minHumdrum
==========

The minHumdrum library is a set of C++ classes for parsing
[Humdrum](http://www.humdrum.org) file data.  The library is designed
to be portable, consisting of two files that can be copied into
your project:

1. An include file [minhumdrum.h](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/minhumdrum.h)
2. and a source file [minhumdrum.cpp](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/src/minhumdrum.cpp)

The classes use some C++11-specific features, so add the
`-stc=c++11` option when compiling with GNU g++ or clang++ compiler.
Also include the `-stdlib=libc++` when compiling with clang.  See the
[Makefile](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/Makefile) 
for compiling the library and
[Makefile.examples](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/Makefile.examples) 
for linking to create executables.


Downloading
===========

To download using git, type:

```console
git clone https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum
```

To update to the most recent version of minHumdrum, type in the minHumdrum directory:

```console
git pull
```


Compiling
==========

When downloading the git repository or a zip/tarball of the repository,
compile the library with the command:

```console
make
```

This should create the file `lib/libminhumdrum.a`, which can be
used to link to other program code. (But note that you also simply
add the .h and .cpp files listed above into your own project files
if you don't want to link against a separately compiled library
file).

For testing purposes, another form of the library can be compiled
from the individual source files for each class:

```console
make lib
```

This will create the file `lib/libhumdrum.a`.


Class overview
==============

The minHumdrum library consists of several classes that abstract
various functionalities for the parser.  Briefly, the HumdrumToken
class manages individual cells of data, with the HumdrumLine managing
simultaneously occurring tokens, and the HumdrumFile manages the
list of lines in a Humdrum score.  A HumdrumFile class is used to
represent a single continuous movement in a musical score.  A class
for managing multiple movements will be added to the code set in
the future.  The figure on the right shows the relationship between
the classes, and a short description of each class is given below:

Here are the classes defined in the minHumdrum library:

* [HumdrumFile](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumFile.h): primary interface for working with Humdrum file data. <img title="class-organization" align="right" width="250" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/gh-pages/images/class-organization.svg">
* [HumdrumFileContent](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumFileContent.h): manages analysis of data content (particularly of **kern data) beyond basic rhythmic analysis done in HumdrumFileStructure.
* [HumdrumFileStructure](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumFileStructure.h): manages rhythmic analysis of the data and extra parameters for data tokens.
* [HumdrumFileBase](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumFileBase.h): manages data storage and reading/writing of Humdrum file data.
(particularly from token strings) into other formats.
* [HumdrumLine](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumLine.h): manages the content of a line (data record) in a Humdrum file.
* [HumdrumToken](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumdrumToken.h): manages tokens (data elements on a line) for HumdrumLine.
* [HumAddress](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumAddress.h): location information for a HumdrumToken on a HumdrumLine and in a HumdrumFile.
* [HumNum](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumNum.h): rational number class for working with durations.
* [HumHash](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumHash.h): associative array for HumdrumLine and HumdrumToken parameters.
* [HumMultiHash](https://github.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/blob/master/include/HumMultiHash.h): associative array for HumdrumFile reference records and parameters.
* [Convert](/class/Convert): utility functions for converting data (primarily for processing HumdrumToken strings).

The following figure shows some sample Humdrum file for a musical score with overlays illustrating how the class structure of a HumdrumFile interacts with the data.  The blue box represents a HumdrumFile.  The file primarily consists of an array of HumdrumLines, indexed from 0.  The HumdrumLine in turn contains a list of HumdrumTokens, indexed by a field number on the line (which are tab-separated strings in the text version of a standard Humdrum file), which is also indexed from 0.

<img title="class-organization" width="600" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/craigsapp/minHumdrum/gh-pages/images/humdrum-file.svg">

A Humdrum file has a two-dimensional organization.  The vertical dimension gives a time ordering of the data, while the horizontal
dimension gives information about the musical parts.  A Humdrum "spine" roughly represents a musical "parts" and the minHumdrum
code provides functionality for iterating through parts between lines.  The minHumdrum code also has a system for iterating through
the spines as "tracks" which are a simplified descriptions of the parts that is similar to standard MIDI file tracks or MEI
layer elements.  The first spine (i.e., column or part) in the above example maps directly into the concept of a "track".  The second
spine splits into two subs-pines starting with the `*^` on line 7 and these two subs-pines merge again into a single spine starting
on line 11 with the pair of `*v` tokens.  Notice how the labeling of the subs-pines differs slightly from how they are labeled
as sub-tracks.

The bottom right portion of the above figure shows the organization of the file in terms of parts (or staves) in the data.  The parts are contained in "spines" which start with a data type, such as `**kern` and end with a data terminator, `*-` (star-dash, not star-underscore).  Humdrum spines can split into two subs-pines (and the sub-spines can split into sub-spines) as shown in the second spine.  A spine is split using the `*^` spine manipulator and can be merged again with the merge manipulator `*v`.  A related concept to spines are "tracks".  Tracks are identical to spines if spines do not split; otherwise, sub-spines and sub-tracks are described slightly differently.  Sub-spines are described by strings which indicate the spine manipulator history of the spine.  For example when spine `2` splits into two sub-spines, the first sub-spine on the line is labeled `(2)a` and the second sub-spine is `(2)b`.  Likewise if the `(2)b` sub-spine splits again, the two sub-spines would be labeled `((2)b)a` and `((2)b)b`.  Sub-tracks are enumerated in the order of their left-to-right occurrence on the line regardless of sub-spine manipulations, so in this example sub-spine `(2)a` is called sub-track `2.1` and sub-spine `(2)b` is called sub-track `2.2`.  If the two sub-spines were to switch their order on the line with the exchange manipulator `*x`, then the sub-track assignments would reverse such that `(2)b` would be sub-track `2.1` and `(2)a` would be sub-track `2.2`.  Note that spine and track labels are indexed from 1 rather than 0.

Code snippets
==============

Here are examples of how to access data in a Humdrum score using the
minHumdrum classes:


1: Read Humdrum data from a file, string or istream:

```cpp
HumdrumFile infile;
infile.read(char* filename);
infile.read(string filename);
```
To read content from a char* or string:

```cpp
infile.parse(stringstream content);
infile.parse(istream content);
infile.read(std::cin);
infile.parse(char* content);
infile.parse(string content);
```

2: Access the token in the second field of the fourth line (`12e` in the above example). This can be done in two ways: either address the HumdrumLine by the [] operator of HumdrumFile and then the data files with HumdrumLine::token, or access the HumdrumToken directly from the HumdrumFile::token function, giving the line and field index as arguments.

```cpp
infile[3].token(1);    // 12e
infile.token(3, 1);    // 12e
```

3: HumdrumTokens inherit from std::string, so the text of the token can be accessed in several ways:

```cpp
(std::string)infile.token(3, 1);   // "12e"
infile.token(3, 1).c_str();        // "12e"
```

4: To access the parsed duration of the token, use the HumdrumToken::getDuration function.  The return value of getDuration() is a "HumNum" which is a rational number, or fraction, consisting of an integer numerator and denominator.  The HumNum::getFloat() function will return the duration as a double:

```cpp
infile.token(3, 1).getDuration();              // 1/3    for "12e"
infile.token(3, 1).getDuration().getFloat();   // 0.3333 for "12e"
```

5: HumdrumLines also possess duration:

```cpp
infile[i].getDuration();  // 1/6 (1/6th of a quarter note, due to the polyrhythm between the parts)
```

6: HumdrumFiles also possess duration:

```cpp
infile.getDuration();    // 3 (one measure of 3/4)
```

7: When converting Humdrum files into MIDI, MuseData, MusicXML or SKINI, the function HumdrumFile::tpq (ticks per quarter note) will return the minimum number of fractional time units necessary to describe all rhythms in the file as integer durations.

```cpp
infile.tpq();           // 6 = minimum time unit is a triplet sixteenth note for example
```

In the case of the musical example further above, the smallest duration is a triplet eighth note, but the minimum time unit between
both parts is a triplet sixteenth note when considering the polyrhythmic interaction between the parts.

8: Durations can be expressed in ticks by giving the tpq value as an argument to the duration functions:

```cpp
int tpq = infile.tpq();                           // 6 ticks per quarter note
infile.token(3, 1).getDuration(tpq).toInteger();  // 2 ticks for a triplet eighth note
infile[3].getDuration(tpq).toInteger();           // 1 tick for a triplet sixteenth note
infile.getDuration(tpq).toInteger();              // 18 ticks for three quarter notes
```

9: Get the total number of HumdrumLines in a HumdrumFile:

```cpp
infile.getLineCount();    // 12
```

10: Get the total number of token fields on a HumdrumLine:

```cpp
infile[3].getTokenCount();  // 2
infile[3].getFieldCount();  // 2
```

12: Get the total number of spines/tracks in a HumdrumFile:

```cpp
infile.getMaxTrack();   // 2
infile.getMaxSpine();   // 2
```

11: Get the track number for a token:

```cpp
infile[3].getTrack(1);   // 2 = second track in file.
```

The "1" is the field number for the second token on the 4th line, which is in the second track of the file.

12: Get the sub-track number for a token:

```cpp
infile[3].getSubtrack(1);  // 0
```

In this case the spine has not split, so the sub-track assignment is 0.  If there were a spine split, then
the sub-track count would start at 1 for the first token on the line in a track, the next token in the
spine would be sub-track 2, and so on.

13: Get the first token in the second spine/track (second `**kern` token on the first line):

```cpp
infile.getTrackStart(2);
```

Note that this will return a pointer rather than a reference to the token.

14:  Ask the starting token how many tokens precede/follow the starting token in the second spine:

```cpp
HumdrumToken* tok = infile.getTrackStart(2);
tok->getNextTokenCount();           // 1 token following in the spine
tok->getPreviousTokenCount();       // 0 tokens preceding in the spine
tok->getNextToken();                // returns pointer to `*M3/4`, using default value of 0 for argument.
tok->getPreviousToken();            // returns NULL
```

The HumdrumToken::getNextTokenCount() function will return 0 for the last token in a spine/track (which always must
be the characters `*-` (start-minus) which is the data terminator token.

Code example
=============

Below is an example program that uses the minHumdrum library to convert a Humdrum file into a MIDI-like listing of notes in the Humdrum score:

```cpp
#include "minhumdrum.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace minHumdrum;

void printNoteInformation(HumdrumFile& infile, int line, int field, int tpq) {
   int starttime = infile[line].getDurationFromStart(tpq).getInteger();
   int duration  = infile.token(line, field).getDuration(tpq).getInteger();
   cout << Convert::kernToSciPitch(infile.token(line, field))
        << '\t' << infile.token(line, field).getTrackString()
        << '\t' << starttime << '\t' << duration << endl;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   if (argc != 2) {
      return 1;
   }
   HumdrumFile infile;
   if (!infile.read(argv[1])) {
      return 1;
   }
   int tpq = infile.tpq();
   cout << "TPQ: " << tpq << endl;
   cout << "PITCH\tTRACK\tSTART\tDURATION" << endl;

   for (int i=0; i<infile.getLineCount(); i++) {
      if (!infile[i].isData()) {
         continue;
      }
      for (int j=0; j<infile[i].getTokenCount(); j++) {
         if (infile.token(i, j).isNull()) {
            continue;
         }
         if (infile.token(i, j).isDataType("kern")) {
            printNoteInformation(infile, i, j, tpq);
         }
      }
   }
   return 0;
}
```

Notice that all minHumdrum code is placed into the minHumdrum namespace.

Test data for use with the above program:

If you are using the minHumdrum project directory, place
programs into a subdirectory called `myprograms` and then to compile,
go to the base directory of the minHumdrum code and type `make myprogram`
if the program is called `myprograms/myprogram.cpp`.  The compiled program
will be created as `bin/myprogram`.


Extracting spines/tracks (~parts)
---------------------------------

Here is another example showing one of the methods which can be used to extract data for
a specific part out of the full-score arrangement of the HumdrumFile data:

```cpp
#include "minhumdrum.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace minHumdrum;

void printNoteInformation(HumdrumToken* tok, int tpq) {
   cout << *tok;
   if (tok->isNonNullData()) {
      cout << "\t->\t" << Convert::kernToSciPitch(*tok)
           << "\t" << tok->getTrackString()
           << "\t" << tok->getDurationFromStart(tpq).getInteger()
           << "\t" << tok->getDuration(tpq).getInteger();
   }
   cout << endl;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   if (argc != 2) {
      return 1;
   }
   HumdrumFile infile;
   if (!infile.read(argv[1])) {
      return 1;
   }
   int tpq = infile.tpq();
   cout << "TPQ: " << tpq << endl;
   cout << "ORIG\t\tPITCH\tTRACK\tSTART\tDURATION" << endl;

   // get the first token in the first spine:
   HumdrumToken* tok = infile.getTrackStart(1);
   // then iterate to the end of the spine:
   while (tok != NULL) {
      printNoteInformation(tok, tpq);
      tok = tok->getNextToken();
   }
   return 0;
}
```

This program should produce the following output given the example input:

```
TPQ: 6
ORIG            PITCH   TRACK   START   DURATION
**kern
*M4/4
8C      ->      C3      1       0       3
.
8B      ->      B3      1       3       3
.
*
4A      ->      A3      1       6       6
4G      ->      G3      1       12      6
*
=
*-
```


Parsing extensions
==================

Standard Humdrum files are encoded as
[TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) (Tab
Separated Values).  The minHumdurm library can also read and write
data in the [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
(Comma Separate Values) format.  This serves two purposes: (1) for
people who cannot wrap their minds around the concept of a tab
character, and (2) for text processing which may munge tabs
(particularly when copy/pasting Humdrum files into email messages).

Use the HumdrumFile::printCSV() funtion to print Humdrum data in the
CSV format.  The example file in CSV format:

```
**kern,**kern
*M4/4,*M4/4
8C,12d
.,12e
8B,.
.,12f
*,*^
4A,2g,4d
4G,.,4c
*,*v,*v
=,=
*-,*-
```

CSV files can be read into a HumdrumFile object by appending "CSV" to the
various read functions, such as readCSV() and parseCSV().
